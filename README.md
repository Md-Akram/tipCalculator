## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript DOM

### What I learned

While doing this project I came across a lot of problems. Majority of those problem was JS related. I solved all of those. I got some hand on practice on JS DOM.

So it can be said that, Updating the UI with JS DOM and using JS Function to do so was the key learning for me.
